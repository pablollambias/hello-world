first repository

As an aspiring Computer Science major, I am dedicated to growing my technical knowledge and expertise in the field. Complementing those skills, I also plan to obtain a minor in either Linguistics or Psychology, as I have great interest in the field of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence in general. My two main overarching interests in the field of Computer Science are obtaining an in-depth knowledge of machine learning tools and process in order to better understand large amounts of data and therefore make better decisions from it, as well as using artificial intelligence in the aforementioned field of Natural Language Processing in order to improve speech recognition and thus be able to better analyze speech patterns, allowing one to make certain conclusions based on the mathematical analysis of speech.
